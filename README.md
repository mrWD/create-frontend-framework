_This project aims to provide a step by step implementation of a "frontend framework". It's only for learning purpose and allows to take a first shot of internal stuff such as templating, state management, and the use of Virtual DOMs._

[NEW: here's another way to implement it using React API and JSX](https://github.com/mfrachet/create-frontend-framework/tree/jsx)

**NEW: the project is now available on github pages! https://mfrachet.github.io/create-frontend-framework/**
